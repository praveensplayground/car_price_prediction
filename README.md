This project involves predicting the prices of cars of different makes. The Jupyter notebook included has the project is tructured into 7 steps.

1. Introduction
2. Data Exploration
3. Data Cleaning
4. Feature engineering
5. Feature selection
6. Model building

Finally, I suggest a method to measure the price depreciation too.
